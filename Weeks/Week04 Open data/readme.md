<p style="text-align: left"> 
If you and your group would like to meet with me for 30 minutes to discuss your proposal, data sources, and python modules/libraries that may benefit your project, please sign up for a time slot on the Google Sheet. Otherwise, I will provide a detailed email with feedback, additional data sources, and python library modules and funcions you will want to look into for your group projects before the midterm on week 6. Send me an email if you would like to schedule an alternative time. </p>



## Hands on Lab
First, grab the course material, and "pull" it into your JupyterHub:

* [UP221 Git Puller](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcgiamarino9%2F25W-UP221&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2F25W-UP221%2F&branch=main) 
(This link will automatically launch JupyterHub and clone the course material into your directory)

<small>Note that you have to do this at the start of every lecture to get the latest material.

# Assignments (due 11:59 Sunday, February 2 the day before class)


## Mini Group Assignment

<left>

For this week's group assignment, meet with your group members and submit a status report as a markdown file in your group repo. This will simply be graded as a "done" or "not done" and count towards your participation grade.
</left>

### Instructions

<left>

Include the following sections:

</left>

<small>

* **Project title and link to proposal**
* **Roles**: Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
* **Status update**: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
* **Data update**: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
* **Concerns**: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."

</small>

### Submit

Submit your updated proposal [here](https://github.com/cgiamarino9/25W-UP221/discussions/8).

## Individual Coding Assignment

<left>
The purpose of this week's coding assignment is for you to advance your coding in a direction that makes sense to you, and to the advancement of your group research project. 
</left>

### Instructions
- Use this week to review: redo, add, replace, review, and/or improve upon past assignments to get a better understanding of the materials and coding structures used
- Follow up on this week's lab: create maps for areas that advance your group research
- Be pragramtic: combine elements from various labs to create unique outputs that specifically advance your research inquiry
- Be innovative: experiment with new datasets/features not covered in class (if this requires a new module/library not covered in class, consult with me first)

### Instructions (cont'd)

<left>
This assignment can be as long or as short as you desire. It is meant to review and advance your understanding of course material. To submit:
</left>

- create a new Python 3 notebook for your assignment
- provide a title and explanatory description of what the purpose of the notebook is
- provide ample markdown cells (preferrably before and after each code cell) that explains what you are going to do, and how you interpret the results)
- upload your notebook to your GitHub account

Submit a link to your notebook [here](https://github.com/cgiamarino9/25W-UP221/discussions/7).
